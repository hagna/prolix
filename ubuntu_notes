is one that is very useful.
1) make sure your script runs [this is always useful ;-p]
2)edit /etc/inittab with your favourite root mode editor [I use sudo vi /etc/inittab YMMV]
2a) find the line
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1
and replace it with
1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f USERNAME tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1
where username is the name of your login user
...what this does is an autologin on tty1 [the 1st terminal]
then edit .bashrc on that user
and right at the end put something like :-
if [ $(tty) == /dev/tty1 ]; then
./script
fi


In ubuntu you edit /etc/init/tty1.conf

Also to turn off motd remove files from /etc/update-motd.d
